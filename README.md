# Portfolio_Website
Portfolio website for my art and code. Will be static for the moment.

3/11/25
My current plan is to have a quick loading screen before the webiste comes up. It'll be 
more for the vibe than for any practical reason. 

After the loading screen there will be a home page with three blocks that are links to
pages with 2D, 3D and coding.

I want the blocks to "float into" their place in the middle of the page then expand when the cursor hovers over them.

My aim right now is the loading screen and home page.
